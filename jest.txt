"Forget so-called peer-pressure. It's more like peer-hunger. No?
We enter a spiritual puberty where we snap to the fact that the
great transcendant horror is loneliness, excluded engagement 
in the self. Once we've hit this age, we will now give or take
anything, wear any mask, to fit, be part-of, not be Alone, we young.

The US arts are our guide to inclusion. A how-to. We are shown how 
to fashion masks of ennui and jaded irony at a young age where the 
face is fictile enough to assume the shape of whatever it wears.
And then it's stuck there, the weary cynicism that saves us from 
gooey sentiment and unsophisticated naivete." ~ Hal
